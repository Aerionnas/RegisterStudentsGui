Project Title: Register Students GUI

Description: This is a simple GU that I create that registers students into a
school registrar. It utilizes Object Oriented Programming and Java Swing.
This is an assignment that I created in one of my computer science classes.

Languages used: Java(Object Oriented Programming and Java Swing)

For this project, I created I used three different files: Student.java,
StudentBody.java, and Registrar.java. Please find information about each of these
files below.

Student.java- this is a Student class that contains the blueprint for Student
Objects. It contains getters, setters, toString methods and a series of for the
methods in the main method.

StudentBody.java- this is a StudentBody class that contains the blueprint for
different StudentBody objects. It creates an arraylist that holds Student objects.
It creates methods that allows you to add, remove, and list all of the students
in the student body. It also contains a series of tests in the main methods.

Registrar.java- this is the file that make this program work. This is were GUI is
created and it calls on methods from the Student and StudentBody classes. This
GUI allows user to add, removes, and list students.


Building this project was a challenge. I had trouble connecting my object classes
to the class that constructed the GUI. For now, users of this GUI are able to only
register students into one school. In the future, I hope to update this project so
that multiple schools are represented.

To run this project, compile the Registrar.java file and run it in the
terminal.
